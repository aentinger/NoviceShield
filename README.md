* 2 push buttons
* 2 RC servo connectors for controlling RC servos
* Fixed and variable voltage divider
* Light sensor (Light Dependent Resistor)
* 2 Temperature sensors: PTC und NTC
* Relay with Optocoupler
* Relay facts:
  * Max. current: 10 A
  * Max. DC voltage: 24 V DC
  * Max. AC voltage: 250 V AC
  * Relay-Typ: SPDT (Single Pole commutator)
* Numerous example program
